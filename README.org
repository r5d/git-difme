* git difme

stages files and makes commits on a list of git repositories based on
some rules.

** rules

the rules specify what type of files to stage.

file types:

   - untracked file (??).
   - modified file (M).
   - deleted file (D).
   - renamed file (R).
   - copied file (C).

the rules are defined per git repository in the config file.

** config

the config file must be at =~/.config/git-difme/config=.

the config is simply a scheme file that defiens =difm-repos=:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define difm-repos (list
                     (cons '/path/to/git/repo/foo '(M D))
                     (cons '/path/to/git/repo/bar '(R M))
                     (cons '/path/to/git/repo/baz '(C M ??))))
#+END_SRC

- for repo ~foo~, git difm will only stage modified (M) and
  deleted (D) files.
- for repo ~bar~, git difm will only stage renamed (R) and modified
  (M) files.
- for repo ~baz~, git difm will only stage copied (C), modified (M)
  and untracked files.
